# ProjectPortfolio-beta

This is the beta version of [ProjectPortfolio](https://github.com/leonardwongly/ProjectPortfolio)

---

The idea is to convert my resume into a viewable portfolio web page. *Also it is fun to do it*
<br/>There isn't much difference between the beta & main codebase. 
Usually updates are done to the beta before it is committed to the main codebase. Hence, more commits are at the beta codebase than the main codebase AKA all the rough edges
